# Tello Tracker Demo Video

The demo video showcases two modes from the script, Webcam and Drone modes.

In webcam mode, the video feed is taken from the laptop camera and detection and servoing are carried out. In drone mode, the video is taken from the camera on DJI Tello drone.

The algorithms used are the same for both cases, but in drone mode, there are flight commands to navigate the drone relative to the control velocities calculated from the visual servoing algorithm.

For more details, please refer to the narration in the video that explains the mechanisms and algorithms presented.
